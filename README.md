### Applicability Estimation Tool 
for Spatial Prediction Models

## Description
This application is a web- based service which provides users with an innovative machine learning toolkit for land use mapping. The unique feature of this toolkit is that it includes the AOA as a standard applicability estimation tool to more accurately assess the reliability of the resulting LULC predictions. In addition, it suggests locations for the collection of additional training data.

## How to install and run the app
To make it as simple as possible you only need to download this repository and run `docker-compsoe up --build`in your command line interface. This installs all dependencies for the font- and backend including all `R` packages. As these packages are not too small this step could take up to 1 hour of building time (depending on your hardware).  
After building, the application will start automatically and you can access the webtool at `http://localhost:8780`.  
If you have terminated the application and want to start it back up at another time you can leave out the `--build` tag of the `docker-compose up` command to start the app again.
