        <b>1.6 Requirements</b><br>
        The requirements of this project are to develop software to run a web-based machine learning toolkit that
        includes:<br>
        • a front-end instance that provides the user interface including a map-application for choosing the area (and
        date) of interest, an interface for uploading training data (e.g., labeled polygons), and the option to choose
        the machine learning algorithm and define the hyperparameters<br>
        • a back-end instance that performs the actual computations, i.e., the training of the defined machine learning
        algorithm, the prediction in the area of interest, the computation of the AOA, and the definition of new
        sampling locations<br>
        The front-end visualizes and provides access to the results of the prediction, the AOA and locations in which
        collection of additional training data is recommended. The back-end instance with some exemplary data and the
        front-end instance should be running at time of project delivery; one or multiple Dockerfile(s) that, when built
        and started, run(s) an instance of the service shall be made available using trimmed-down data sets.<br>
        <br>
        <b>1.6.1 Functional requirements</b><br>
        The following functional requirements extend and clarify the above overall require- ments, but they may not
        cover all features needed to realise the project goals.<br>
        Data ingest<br>
        • support loading training data via direct file upload to the server<br>
        • support at least file formats GeoJSON and GeoPackage<br>
        • the server automatically discovers and processes (accesses, or downloads) the satellite imagery from other
        sources as required for model training and pre- diction based on the locations and extents of the area of
        interest and training data<br>
        • example satellite data for demonstration purposes is being kept available on the server<br>
        <br>
        <b>Processes</b><br>
        • implement at least one standard machine learning algorithm for LULC classifi- cation supporting training and
        prediction on Sentinel-2 satellite image data<br>
        • implement the computation of the AOA<br>
        • implement the automatic calculation of suggested sampling locations<br>
        • allow the user to specify the target area (rectangular)<br>
        • BONUS feature: enable the choice between different established machine learn- ing algorithms and/or the
        definition of hyperparameters controlling the be- haviour of an algorithm<br>
        • BONUS feature: allow the user to specify a lower resolution to compute predic- tions and AOA on than the
        native resolution of the satellite imagery used<br>
        • BONUS feature: allow the user to specify the target area by means of polygon data (e.g. by file upload, or
        on-screen digitizing)<br>
        <br>
        Visualization<br>
        • visualize the training locations (if applicable) and area of interest on a map<br>
        • visualize the resulting prediction on a map<br>
        • visualize the AOA on a map<br>
        • visualize locations where additional training data collection is recommended<br>
        <b>Data Download</b><br>
        • enable the download of the prediction map in a standard raster data format<br>
        • enable the download of the AOA in a standard raster data format<br>
        • enable the download of recommended locations for training data collection in a standard vector data format<br>
        • enable download of the trained model (if applicable) Deployment<br>
        <br>
        <b>1.6.2 Non-functional requirements</b><br>
        Docker/docker-compose configurations are used for packaging and deployment
        the developed back-end can be deployed to at least one cloud provider, chosen in coordination with the customer
        Non-functional requirements<br>
        Training and Demonstration For training and demonstration purposes, a one- click set-up to deploy a test
        scenario must be provided. The scenario must include a data set and process that allows a quick evaluation,
        i.e., processing times less than 20 seconds. These small datasets may be included within the software
        containers. The contractor provides a test script or test suite to execute demo process and validate its
        response with a single command or click.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Maintainability</b><br>
        The developed software must be published as open source software under an OSI-approved license
        according to the license requirements. The contractor must ensure license compatibility of other used or
        extended software.<br>
        An established build and packaging workflow as well as dependency management must be applied, e.g., R packages
        for R, npm for JavaScript, or PyPI packages for Python. If more than one programming language is used in a
        component then different build and packaging steps must be scripted with a Makefile.<br>
        Documentation on building, installing, testing, and configuring the system must be provided in
        Markdown-formatted documentation files using the appropriate markup for lists, links, etc. The documentation
        must be rendered to an online website.<br>
        A common test software, e.g., testthat for R, must be used to realise unit and integration tests for all
        requirements.<br>
        <br>
        <b>User friendliness </b><br>
        The system must support intuitive use to the extent that the targeted group can use its
        features without further documentation. Common practices for web-based user interfaces and interaction paradigms
        should be applied. The user interface and visualisation must be suitable for color-blind users. The system must
        be tested and fully functional with browsers representing at least 80% of current users.
        <br>
        <b>Performance</b><br>
        In general, a user interaction must result in a display change within 1 second to allow users to
        stay focused on their current train of thought; complex page contents may be loaded asynchronously; interactive
        visualisations must react within 0.1 seconds to give a user the impression of direct manipulation.4
        <br>
        <b>Deployment</b><br>
        Docker must be used to ensure easy deployment. Used images must be based on Dockerfiles published as
        part of the source code, and all base images should be hosted on Docker Hub (or comparable).
        <br>
        <b>Project management</b><br>
        The customer must be given access to the contractor’s on- line task management to observe the
        progress.
